1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element
--------------------------------------------------------
Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. 
Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number at index 2, we get [1,1,1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number at index 4, we get [1,1,1,1,1].

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: We must delete one element, so the longest subarray is [1,1].

# Intuition
We want the longest contiguous block of 1â€™s after deleting exactly one element.  
This means our subarray can contain at most **one zero** inside it.

# Approach (Sliding Window)
- Maintain a window `[left, right]` with at most **one zero** inside it.
- Use a counter `zero_cnt` to track how many zeros are in the current window.
- Expand `right` as we iterate.
- If `zero_cnt > 1`, shrink the window by moving `left` until only one zero remains.
- Track the maximum length as `right - left` (not `+1` because one deletion is mandatory).

# Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), since each element is processed at most twice (entering and leaving the window).
- Space Complexity: O(1), only a few variables are used.
